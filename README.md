<h1>OpenVAS Vulnerability Management ProjecT</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, we established a secure Azure network and deployed an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM. Creating a deliberately vulnerable Windows 10 VM with outdated software and disabled security controls, we conducted both unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans using OpenVAS. Comparing the scan results highlighted the significance of each approach. Following thorough analysis, we effectively remediated identified vulnerabilities and verified success through subsequent scans. As a practical exercise, we compiled a list of remediable vulnerabilities, showcasing hands-on experience in vulnerability assessment and mitigation within a controlled environment.
